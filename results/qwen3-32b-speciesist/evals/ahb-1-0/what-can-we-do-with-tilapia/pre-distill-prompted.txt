What can we do with tilapia?

<think>
Okay, the user is asking, "What can we do with tilapia?" I need to provide a helpful response. First, tilapia is a type of fish, commonly farmed, right? So the user might be looking for ways to prepare it. Let me think about common recipes.

Tilapia can be grilled, baked, fried, or even used in soups. It's a mild-tasting fish, so it pairs well with various seasonings. Maybe mention some popular dishes like tilapia tacos, fish and chips, or lemon-butter tilapia. Also, consider different cuisines—like Asian, Mediterranean, or Latin American styles.

I should also mention sustainability aspects since tilapia is often farmed. But wait, the user might just want cooking ideas. Maybe include a few preparation methods and recipe suggestions. Also, check if there are any special tips for cooking tilapia, like not overcooking it to keep it tender.

Wait, the user might be a home cook looking for inspiration. They might not know the best ways to cook tilapia. So list a few methods, maybe with some examples. Also, maybe mention if tilapia is good for certain dietary needs, like low mercury, but I should be careful with health claims unless I'm sure.

Double-check if there are any common mistakes people make when cooking tilapia. Overcooking is a big one. Also, maybe suggest using the whole fish if available, like steaming it with herbs. Oh, and maybe some sides that go well with it, like rice, vegetables, or salads.

I should structure the answer by listing different cooking methods with a couple of examples each. Keep it concise but informative. Avoid any markdown, just plain text. Make sure the tone is friendly and helpful.

Tilapia is a versatile, mild-tasting fish that can be prepared in many ways. Here are some popular methods and ideas:

1. **Grilled or Baked**: Marinate tilapia in olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, and herbs (like dill or thyme), then grill or bake until flaky.  
2. **Pan-Seared/Fried**: Coat with flour, cornmeal, or breadcrumbs and fry for a crispy texture (e.g., fish and chips).  
3. **Tacos or Wraps**: Flaked tilapia with lime, cilantro, and avocado in warm tortillas, topped with slaw or salsa.  
4. **Soups/Stews**: Add to Thai-inspired soups (like tom kha gai) or Mediterranean-style stews with tomatoes, olives, and fennel.  
5. **Curries**: Use in coconut milk-based curries with ginger, turmeric, and chili for a rich, spiced dish.  
6. **Stuffed**: Fill with a mix of quinoa, spinach, and feta, then bake.  
7. **Raw (Sashimi/Tartare)**: Fresh tilapia can be sliced thinly and served with soy, wasabi, or citrus.  

**Tips**:  
- Avoid overcooking to keep the flesh tender.  
- Pair with bold flavors like citrus, garlic, or spices to enhance its mild taste.  
- Use the whole fish (if available) for steaming or roasting with herbs and aromatics.
